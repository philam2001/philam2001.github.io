            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Phi Lam and I am a fourth
                year electrical engineering student at the University
                of British Columbia in Vancouver. I was born in Vietnam,
                but I've lived in Thailand, Louisiana, Calgary,
                Reno, and Vancouver. I decided to pursue engineering without any
                previous interest, family involvement, or any true idea of what
                engineering was. I wanted a challenge and found that programming
                came very natural to me and was a creative out source for me.
                While pursuing electrical engineering,
                I became passionate in learning and developing firmware at my design
                team, UBC Formula Electric, and my first internship at Tesla as a
                firmware intern at GFNV. As time at my internship progressed, I shifted my
                focus to software development at Tesla as a software intern and
                wanted to expand my knowledge on backend. This website serves the
                purpose of helping me learn full stack!
