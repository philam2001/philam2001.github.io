        Programming notes:
    </h1>
    <p>
        There are a few languages I've been trying out, trying to learn, or maintain. I would say
        C and Golang are my most comfortable languages. Learning C was my first exposure to programming
        in my first year of engineering at UBC and I remember thinking about how natural it came to me.
        I decided on electrical engineering as it was interesting nonetheless, but I do want to pursue
        a career in software or firmware.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use C for my firmware role at Tesla when I was working on the R&D project as well as on my FSAE
        team at UBC! I was first exposed to Golang while creating a script for my firmware project to send,
        receive, encode, and decode protobuf packets through an MQTT broker to the embedded system via an ethernet.
        I used it more extensively when working on the software for production testers.

    <h4>
        Golang
    </h4>
    <p>
        I found Golang to be a very interesting language, it being statically typed and it being nit-picky/reliable.
        It's ideal for system software (run computers hardware and manage computer's resources).
        It's procedural like python (programs executed in a certain sequence), but it has a light weight concurrent
        aspect that makes running concurrent processes easily. These are called go routines. It's also more of a
        functional language compared to python being OO, thus it's better used for applications that need to have
        multiple operations performed. It's perfect for production in my opinion as its more lightweight and
        won't take up unnecesary space.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm trying to learn HTML, CCS, and JS for fun outside of my electrical engineering classes
        and design team, making that the purpose of this project. I'm also trying to learn Python
        due to its popularity in the industry and its OOP style.
