                        My name is Phi Lam, and I'm studying Electrical Engineering at the University of British
                        Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I was born in Vietnam but have lived in Bangkok ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­, Louisiana ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸,
                        Calgary ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, Reno ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and Vancouver ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. My engineering journey started as a challenge to overcome, as
                        I had no prior knowledge of what engineering or programming even was. I grew to enjoy seeing how it
                        could be used for personal projects to solving complex systems for big, interdisplinary team projects.
                        A lot of what I know is self-taught, whether itâ€™s firmware development, full-stack development, diving into distributed systems, driver-level
                        development and debugging, or exploring cloud computing, and etc.
